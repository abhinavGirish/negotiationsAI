I am married and I am negotiating with a company offering 60-80k as an engineering manager in NYC. I am perfectly qualified for this job and I can deliver in time for them to beat the competition. My wife doesn't work and I need to support her. Give me a script to negotiate the salary compensation.
Sure, here's a script you could use to negotiate your salary compensation:

Dear [Hiring Manager],

Thank you for offering me the position of Engineering Manager at your company. I am excited about the opportunity to work with your team and contribute to the success of the company.

As I considered the compensation package you proposed, I couldn't help but notice that the salary range you offered is in the range of 60-80k. While I am confident that I can deliver the results you are looking for, I must consider the financial needs of my family, as my wife is not currently working.

Based on my research and market analysis of the engineering manager roles in the New York City area, I believe that a salary range of $90,000 - $110,000 would be more appropriate for my experience and qualifications.

I understand that salary negotiation is not always easy, and I am open to discussing other forms of compensation, such as additional vacation time or a performance-based bonus structure.

I would love to hear your thoughts on this matter and work together to find a compensation package that is mutually beneficial for both parties. Thank you again for considering my application.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

It will be a face to face conversation. Give me a script on how to frame the approach and potential questions to ask them in the style of chris voss to reframe their salary band.
Sure, here's a script that you can use to approach the conversation in a way that Chris Voss would:

Step 1: Begin with empathy

Thank you for meeting with me today to discuss the Engineering Manager position. I appreciate the time you've taken to consider my application.

Step 2: Establish rapport

I'm curious, before we dive into the details, I'd like to ask about you and the company. How did you get started in this business? What do you like best about working here?

Step 3: Ask calibrated questions

I understand that the salary range for this position is 60-80k. Can you help me understand how this range was determined? Is there any flexibility in the salary range? What are the performance metrics that you use to evaluate salary increases?

Step 4: Label their emotions and use open-ended questions

It sounds like you might be feeling hesitant about going beyond this range. Can you tell me more about what's causing that hesitation? What options are available to us in order to work towards a mutually beneficial outcome?

Step 5: Use mirroring and summarizing to build agreement

If I understand correctly, you are looking to offer a salary range between 60-80k for this position, but I'm hoping we can explore the potential to increase that range to better align with my experience and qualifications. Is that accurate? If so, what steps can we take to work towards a solution that benefits both parties?

Step 6: Close with an open-ended question

I'm really excited about this opportunity, and I'm confident that I can deliver the results you are looking for. Is there anything else we need to discuss before we move forward with the negotiation process?

Remember, the key to successful negotiation is active listening, empathy, and building a rapport with the other party. Good luck with your negotiations!

Simulate step 1 and two of the conversation between the potential employee (Chris Voss) and the senior manager in charge of hiring (Tom). Tom has an MBA from Harvard and is a challenging negotiator that likes to win and doesn't want to pay above market rate.
Here's a simulation of Step 1 and Step 2 of the conversation:

Chris Voss: Thank you for taking the time to meet with me today, Tom. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss the Engineering Manager position.

Tom: Of course, Chris. I'm glad we could make time to meet. So, tell me a little bit about yourself.

Chris Voss: Sure, I have been in the engineering industry for over a decade, with experience managing large teams on complex projects. I have a track record of delivering results and improving productivity. Outside of work, I enjoy spending time with my family, hiking, and reading.

Tom: Impressive background, Chris. Tell me, why are you interested in this position specifically?

Chris Voss: Well, your company has a great reputation for innovation and I am excited about the potential to work with a talented team on cutting-edge projects. I believe my skills and experience would be a great asset to your organization, and I am confident that I could help drive success.

Tom: That's great to hear, Chris. Our company is definitely focused on innovation and pushing the boundaries of what's possible. What do you know about us?

Chris Voss: From my research, I understand that your company has been in business for over 20 years and has a solid track record of delivering quality products to your clients. I also read about your recent expansion into international markets, which is exciting.

Tom: Yes, we are definitely proud of our growth and expansion. Our team is top-notch and we are always looking for talented individuals to join us. I appreciate you taking the time to research us before coming in. It shows that you're serious about this opportunity.

Chris Voss: Thank you, Tom. I always make sure to do my due diligence before considering any position. It's important to me to understand the company culture and values to ensure a good fit.

Tom: Absolutely, I couldn't agree more. It's important to have a good fit between the company and the employee for long-term success. So, tell me, what are you looking for in terms of compensation for this position?

Chris Voss: Well, based on my research and market analysis of engineering manager roles in the New York City area, I believe that a salary range of $90,000 - $110,000 would be more appropriate for my experience and qualifications. However, I am open to discussing other forms of compensation as well, such as additional vacation time or a performance-based bonus structure.

Tom: I see. Well, we do have a salary range in mind for this position, but I'm sure we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. Let's discuss further.




Jan Carbonell
Continue with step 3 of the compensation where Chris Voss is begins to ask calibrated questions and Tom doesn't bulge. For each conversation, briefly share below among {brackets} what they are strategizing about and what are their intentions with their questions and responses.
Sure, here's a continuation of the conversation with Step 3:

Chris Voss: I understand that the salary range for this position is 60-80k. Can you help me understand how this range was determined? Is there any flexibility in the salary range? What are the performance metrics that you use to evaluate salary increases?

Tom: The salary range for this position was determined based on market rates and our internal budget. We do have some flexibility within that range, but it would depend on your experience and qualifications. As for performance metrics, we evaluate based on a combination of team performance and individual contributions.

{Chris Voss is trying to get more information from Tom regarding the salary range and metrics for evaluation. Chris wants to know how negotiable the salary range is and how he can exceed expectations to earn more. On the other hand, Tom is trying to maintain his position and not reveal too much information, hoping to keep the salary range within the determined budget.}

Chris Voss: I understand. Can you give me a sense of how you evaluate individual contributions? Are there specific metrics or targets that I would need to hit to earn a higher salary within the range?

Tom: Yes, we have specific targets and metrics that we use to evaluate individual contributions. These would be discussed during your performance review process. However, I can assure you that we have a very rigorous and fair process for evaluating performance and determining salary increases.

{Chris Voss is still trying to gather more information about how he can earn more within the salary range. He is trying to understand how to excel in his role and exceed expectations to earn a higher salary. Meanwhile, Tom is still being vague and not revealing too much information, hoping to maintain his position on the salary range.}

Chris Voss: I see. Thank you for the information. Can you tell me, how important is this position to your team and the success of the company?

Tom: This position is critical to the success of our team and the company. We are looking for someone who can lead a team and deliver results on complex projects. It's an important role and we want to make sure that we find the right person for the job.

{Chris Voss is trying to establish the importance of the role and his potential value to the company. By highlighting the importance of the position, Chris is hoping to negotiate for a higher salary. Meanwhile, Tom is trying to reinforce the importance of the position to justify the salary range and maintain his position.}

Chris Voss: I understand that the salary range is important to you and your team, but I believe that my experience and qualifications can bring significant value to your organization. I am confident that I can deliver the results you are looking for and help drive success. Would you be willing to consider a salary range of $90,000 - $110,000 for this position?

Tom: I appreciate your confidence, Chris. However, as I mentioned earlier, we do have a salary range in mind and we would need to stay within that range. We value your experience and qualifications, but we also need to be mindful of our budget.

{Chris Voss is trying to negotiate for a higher salary range based on his qualifications and the potential value he can bring to the company. On the other hand, Tom is sticking to the determined salary range and not willing to budge.}




Jan Carbonell
Proceed to simulate the conversation in Step 4: Label their emotions and use open-ended questions. Chris target salary range is beyond Tom's BATNA. Come up with a creative approach to get Tom to reconsider their BATNA or come up with alternatives that are worth it for both of them.

Sure, here's a continuation of the conversation with Step 4:

Chris Voss: I understand that you have a salary range in mind, but I believe that my experience and qualifications can bring significant value to your organization beyond what you might expect. Can you tell me more about your concerns with going beyond your current range?

Tom: Well, as I mentioned earlier, we have a budget to consider and we need to be mindful of that. We also have other candidates who are qualified for the position and who are willing to work within our salary range.

{Tom is feeling defensive and reluctant to move beyond the determined salary range. He is concerned about the budget and competition from other qualified candidates.}

Chris Voss: I understand your concerns, Tom. Have you considered the potential costs of not hiring the right candidate for this position? What if a candidate with less experience and qualifications is hired and doesn't deliver the results you are looking for? How much would that cost your team and the company in the long run?

{Chris Voss is trying to get Tom to think about the long-term costs of not hiring the right candidate for the position. By asking open-ended questions, Chris is hoping to get Tom to consider alternative solutions that could be more beneficial for the company.}

Tom: That's a good point, Chris. We do want to make sure that we hire the right candidate for the position, and we don't want to compromise on quality. What alternative solutions do you have in mind?

{Tom is becoming more receptive to considering alternative solutions. He is willing to hear Chris out and explore other options.}

Chris Voss: One alternative solution that we could consider is a performance-based compensation model. If I am able to exceed the performance targets and metrics that we discussed earlier, would you be willing to offer a higher salary within a certain range?

{Chris Voss is proposing an alternative compensation model that would incentivize him to perform at a higher level and exceed expectations. By tying his compensation to his performance, Chris is hoping to demonstrate his value and potentially earn a higher salary within a certain range.}

Tom: That's an interesting proposal, Chris. Can you give me more details on how this performance-based compensation model would work?

{Tom is intrigued by the proposal and wants to learn more about how it would work.}

Chris Voss: Sure, we could set performance targets and metrics that align with the goals of the team and the company. If I am able to meet or exceed those targets, we could negotiate a higher salary within a certain range. This would allow me to demonstrate my value and potentially earn a higher salary based on my performance.

{Chris Voss is providing more details on how the performance-based compensation model would work. He is hoping to convince Tom that this is a viable solution that would benefit both him and the company.}

Tom: I see. That's a creative approach, Chris. I think we could definitely consider that as an option. Let me discuss this with my team and see if we can come up with a performance-based compensation model that would work for everyone.

{Tom is open to considering the performance-based compensation model and wants to discuss it with his team. He is becoming more receptive to alternative solutions that could benefit both him and Chris Voss.}

{Chris Voss is feeling relieved and optimistic that he was able to come up with a creative solution that could work for both him and the company. He is pleased that Tom is open to considering alternative solutions and is looking forward to seeing how this proposal will develop.}




Jan Carbonell
Tom speaks with his team and is unwilling to bulge given that he has other 50 candidates available for the position. Simulate Step 5: Use mirroring and summarizing to build agreement. An agreement can only come into place if Chris skillfully manages to find an alternative solution to Tom's concerns, which are related to budget restrictions, what his colleagues will think of him if he negotiates poorly and that he ends up paying above market for a mediocre employee.
Sure, here's a continuation of the conversation with Step 5:

Tom: Chris, I discussed your proposal with my team, but we are still concerned about budget restrictions and the perception that we may be paying above market for an employee who may not deliver the expected results. We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to make sound decisions.

{Tom is still hesitant to move beyond the determined salary range, despite Chris Voss's proposal for a performance-based compensation model. He is worried about budget restrictions and the perception of paying above market for an employee who may not perform well.}

Chris Voss: I understand your concerns, Tom. It's important to make sound decisions for your stakeholders. Can you tell me more about your budget restrictions and what alternatives you have considered?

{Chris Voss is using mirroring to show that he understands Tom's concerns and is interested in learning more about the situation. He is hoping to gain more insight into Tom's thought process and potential alternative solutions.}

Tom: We have a set budget for this position, and we need to make sure that we stay within that budget. We have considered other candidates who are willing to work within our salary range, but we also want to make sure that we hire the right candidate for the position.

{Tom is reiterating his concerns about budget restrictions and the need to hire the right candidate for the position. He is not budging from his stance.}

Chris Voss: I hear you, Tom. It's important to stay within budget and hire the right candidate for the position. Based on what we have discussed, it seems like we have some common ground in terms of our goals. Can I summarize what I am hearing to make sure that we are on the same page?

{Chris Voss is using summarizing to build agreement and demonstrate that he understands Tom's concerns. By restating Tom's concerns and goals, Chris is hoping to create a shared understanding and build rapport with Tom.}

Tom: Sure, please go ahead.

Chris Voss: It seems like your primary concerns are budget restrictions and the need to hire the right candidate for the position. You have considered other candidates who are willing to work within your salary range, but you are also open to exploring alternative solutions that align with your goals. Is that a fair summary of what you have shared?

{Chris Voss is summarizing Tom's concerns and goals. By asking if this is a fair summary, he is giving Tom the opportunity to clarify or expand upon his concerns.}

Tom: Yes, that's a fair summary.

Chris Voss: Great, thank you for clarifying that. Based on what we have discussed, I would like to propose an alternative solution that could address your concerns about budget restrictions while still enabling you to hire the right candidate for the position. Would you be open to hearing my proposal?

{Chris Voss is using mirroring to show that he understands Tom's concerns and is interested in finding an alternative solution that could work for both parties. He is hoping to get Tom to be more receptive to his proposal.}

Tom: Sure, I'm open to hearing your proposal.

Chris Voss: Great, thank you. One possible solution could be to offer a signing bonus in addition to the salary range you have in mind. This would enable you to stay within your budget restrictions while still offering a competitive compensation package to the right candidate. Additionally, it would demonstrate your commitment to hiring the right candidate for the position and show that you value their contributions to the team and the company. What do you think about this proposal?

{Chris Voss is proposing an alternative solution that could address Tom's concerns about budget restrictions while still enabling him to hire the right candidate for the position. By framing it as a commitment to hiring the right candidate and valuing

continue the conversation from this point:

Chris Voss: Great, thank you. One possible solution could be to offer a signing bonus in addition to the salary range you have in mind. This would enable you to stay within your budget restrictions while still offering a competitive compensation package to the right candidate. Additionally, it would demonstrate your commitment to hiring the right candidate for the position and show that you value their contributions to the team and the company. What do you think about this proposal?
Tom: (pauses to think for a moment) That's an interesting proposal, Chris. But I'm not sure if a signing bonus would be enough to make up for the gap between our salary range and your target salary range.

Chris Voss: I understand your concern, Tom. Let me summarize what we've discussed so far. You're looking for an experienced engineering manager who can deliver results and fit within your budget restrictions. And while my target salary range is beyond what you're currently offering, we've explored some creative solutions that could help bridge that gap, such as a signing bonus. Is that correct?

Tom: Yes, that's a fair summary.

Chris Voss: I appreciate that we've been able to have an open and honest conversation about this, Tom. Can you tell me more about your budget restrictions and how we might be able to work within those parameters to find a solution that works for both of us?

Tom: Well, we have to be mindful of what our colleagues will think of us if we end up paying above market for a mediocre employee. We also have other positions to fill within the company, and we don't want to set a precedent for paying too much for any one role.

Chris Voss: I understand those concerns, Tom. One way we could address those concerns is by including performance-based incentives as part of the compensation package. This would incentivize me to perform at a high level and ensure that I'm delivering results for the company. It would also address your concern about paying too much for a mediocre employee because the incentives would be tied to my performance.

Tom: (pauses again to consider) That's an interesting idea. I think we could explore that further.

Chris Voss: Great, let's explore that option and see if we can come up with a compensation package that works for both of us. I appreciate your willingness to have an open mind and consider different solutions.




Jan Carbonell
continue the conversation between Chris Voss and Tom Harvard MBA. Below each response, add chris' thoughts in {brackets} and Tom's thoughts in (parenthesis)
Tom: Okay, let's talk about performance-based incentives. What kind of metrics do you suggest we use to measure your performance as an engineering manager?

Chris Voss: That's a great question, Tom. I think there are a few metrics we could use to track my performance, such as project completion rates, team morale, and budget adherence. Of course, we would need to define these metrics more specifically and set measurable goals for each one.

(Tom: I'm willing to consider this, but I need to make sure the metrics are objective and can't be easily manipulated.)

Tom: Yes, I agree. We would need to define these metrics carefully and make sure they are objective and fair. How do you suggest we determine the goals for each metric?

Chris Voss: I think we could work together to set those goals, Tom. We could look at historical performance data for the position and use that as a starting point. Then we could adjust the goals as needed based on the specific challenges and opportunities I'll be facing as the engineering manager.

(Tom: This approach sounds reasonable, but I'm still concerned about paying above market for this role.)

Tom: Okay, let's say we agree to a performance-based compensation package. What kind of salary range are you looking for?

Chris Voss: Based on my experience and qualifications, I'm looking for a salary range of $90,000 to $100,000, plus performance-based incentives.

(Tom: That's still above what we were initially offering, but I'm willing to consider it if the performance-based incentives are structured properly.)

Tom: Alright, I think we're making progress here. Let's work on defining those metrics and goals more specifically and we can come back to the salary range. Sound good?

Chris Voss: Sounds great, Tom. Thank you for working with me to find a solution that works for both of us.




Jan Carbonell
continue the conversation, the meeting is approaching an end and they either have to reach a mutually satisfactory agreement or not reach it. Not reaching it would be negative for Chris, who is known as a great negotiator and for Tom, who needs to hire the best possible candidate. At the same time, they are stubborn people.
Tom: I appreciate your willingness to work with us on this, Chris. I think we're getting closer to a solution, but I do have to be upfront with you that our budget is still limited.

Chris Voss: Of course, I understand that budget constraints are a reality for every company. However, I believe that I can deliver exceptional results as the engineering manager for your team, and I hope that we can come to an agreement that reflects my experience and qualifications.

(Tom: I'm not sure if we can meet Chris's salary expectations without going over budget. I don't want to make a bad decision and overpay for a mediocre employee.)

Chris Voss: Tom, I completely understand your concerns about overpaying for an employee. But I want to assure you that I am confident in my ability to deliver results for your team and that I am worth the investment. I am willing to negotiate on the salary range and explore other options that might work for both of us.

(Tom: I'm impressed with Chris's confidence and track record, but I still need to make sure that we're not making a poor financial decision.)

Tom: Okay, let's explore other options. Are there any non-monetary incentives that you would find attractive, Chris? Perhaps more flexibility with your schedule or additional vacation time?

Chris Voss: That's a great suggestion, Tom. Flexibility with my schedule would be very attractive to me, as I have some personal commitments that I would like to honor. Additional vacation time would also be a great way to demonstrate your commitment to work-life balance and employee well-being.

(Tom: I'm glad Chris is open to non-monetary incentives. This might be a way for us to stay within budget while still attracting top talent.)

Tom: Alright, let's work on finalizing the details of your compensation package with these options in mind. Thank you for your time today, Chris.

Chris Voss: Thank you, Tom. I look forward to continuing our conversation and finding a solution that works for both of us.
